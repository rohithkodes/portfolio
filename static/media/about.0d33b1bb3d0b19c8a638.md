Hey! I'm a Game Developer with experience building interactive applications and multiplayer games using **Unity**. I work primarily with **C#** and **C++**, and I’ve been involved in designing both gameplay systems and the architecture that supports them.

My experience includes developing *multiplayer educational games* from the ground up, creating internal tools to support game integration, and working closely with teams to solve implementation issues. I’m especially interested in systems design and making development more efficient through thoughtful architecture.
